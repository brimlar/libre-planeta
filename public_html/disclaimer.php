<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
Homeplaneta is a website where anyone -- a private homeowner, realtor or real estate company -- can list their property for rent
or for sale, for free.  The content that is available here is user-generated, and Homeplaneta does not take any responsibility for
the accuracy or truthfulness of these listings -- these listings are the responsibility of the user, and all inquiries or complaints
 about a particular listing should be sent to the owner who posted it.  Homeplaneta does not verify or substantiate any of the claims herein, 
and any usage of this website is at your own risk.<br /><br />
Posters of listings should take care to adhere and to follow your local laws concerning discrimination or other matters pertaining to housing advertising.
<br /><br />
For our free listings, our goal is to keep them up for a period of 30 days, after which time
the user may have the opportunity to re-post their property.  Paid listings will expire at a variable time determined by the number of days the user has purchased.  We reserve the right to modify or delete a listing <b>for any reason</b>, but this scenario would most likely occur if:
<ul style="margin: 8px; margin-left: 30px;">
<li>we receive complaints about your listing</li>
<li>if it is negatively affecting the technical operations of the website, or</li>
<li>if we feel the listing breaks commonly-held standards of decency and legality.</li>
</ul>
Homeplaneta reserves the right to make any changes to the service at any time.
